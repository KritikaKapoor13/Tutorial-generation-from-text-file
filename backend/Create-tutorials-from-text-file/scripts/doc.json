["<h1>Web Development ", "<h2>What Are Web Technologies? ", "<p>Web technologies are the various tools and techniques that are utilised in the process of  communication between different types of devices over the internet.  To understand this term in a better manner, lets break it down into two pieces: web  and technology.  The web, in this case, refers to the World Wide Web, more commonly known as WWW.  It first came into being in 1989 when famous scientist and engineer, Tim Berners-Lee,  came up with an efficient mechanism to share resources between scientists all over the  world. ", "<h2>What Are The Different Types Of Web Technologies? ", "<p>Since we have a limited space to examine the wide array of web technologies available,  we have picked a few that are used most often by both beginners and experts in the  industry. We have divided them into the following sections:  1. The basics, which will cover web browsers and some web app development  fundamentals  2. Programming languages and frameworks which are used in the development  of websites  3. Databases that are used at the backend to store data required or collected  by websites  4. Some protocols, that is, rules for communicating on the web  5. Graphic, audiovisual, and other multimedia elements  6. Some data formats that are usually used to transmit data over the internet  7. Other miscellaneous web technologies ", "<h2>The Basics ", "<p>In this section, we will talk about web browsers and some other web fundamentals. ", "<h3>Web Browsers ", "<p>Web browsers, often just called browsers, make it possible for us to view all the  resources that are part of the World Wide Web. They are based on a client-server  architecture. The client is the browser in this scenario. You can think of the server as a  combination of software and hardware that receives the clients requests and then  sends the requested resource to the client.  Whenever you enter a URL into a browsers address bar, it relays your request to the  server and then fetches and displays whatever the user requested for.  Some popular web browsers are Opera, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari. ", "<h2>Frontend Vs Backend Development Technologies ", "<h4>What is web development? ", "<p>Web development refers to the process of creating websites. This process is based on  a number of steps, which we will cover in more detail when we explore the tools  involved in each process. ", "<h4>The two parts of a typical website ", "<p>As we go further, we will discuss individual web development technologies and tools  used to create websites. But before that, we need to be clear on the two distinct parts of  a website: the frontend and the backend.  Frontend refers to all those parts of a website that a user can see on their screen and  interact with.  Backend refers to the exact opposite of that. It involves the hidden mechanisms that  make a webpage function. A typical user is generally unaware of what goes on at the  backend. "]
